# ZFC-like Axioms (not executable, described in comments)
# Axiom 1: Extensionality: Sets with same elements are equal
# Axiom 2: Pairing: For sets a, b, exists set {a, b}
# Axiom 3: Union: For set A, exists union of A
# Axiom 4: Power Set: For set A, exists power set P(A)
# Axiom 5: Infinity: Exists an infinite set
# Axiom 6: Separation: For set A and property phi, exists {x in A | phi(x)}
# Axiom 7: Replacement: Image of a set under a function is a set
# Axiom 8: Choice: Every set of nonempty sets has a choice function
# Axiom 9: Algebraic Structures: Exists sets with group/ring/field operations
# Axiom 10: Category Axiom: Exists categories Set, Grp, Rng, Fld
